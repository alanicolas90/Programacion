                <p>Lord Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the wizarding and Muggle worlds, kidnapping Ollivander
                    from
                    Diagon Alley and destroying the Millennium Bridge. After the Malfoy family is disgraced when Lucius
                    is
                    apprehended and sent to Azkaban for his involvement with the Death Eaters, Voldemort chooses Draco
                    to
                    carry out a secret mission at Hogwarts. Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy, Draco's mother,

                    help from Severus Snape, who claims to have been acting as a mole within the Order of the Phoenix

                <p><span>Running time:</span> N/S</p>
                <p>Bilbo Baggins, the titular protagonist, is a respectable, reserved hobbit.[4][5] During his
                    adventure,
                    Bilbo often refers to the contents of his larder at home and wishes he had more food. Until he finds
                    a
                    magic ring, he is more baggage than help. Gandalf, an itinerant wizard,[6] introduces Bilbo to a
                    company
                    of thirteen dwarves. During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at, only
                    to
                    appear again at key moments in the story. Thorin Oakenshield, the proud, pompous[7][8] head of the
                    company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain, makes many
                    mistakes in his leadership, relying on Gandalf and Bilbo to get him out of trouble, but he proves
                    himself a mighty warrior. Smaug is a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorin's
                    grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure.</p>

                <p><span>Running time:</span> 100 minutes</p>
                <p>The film centers on a lonely eight-year-old boy named Max who sails away to an island inhabited by
                    creatures known as the "Wild Things," who declare Max their king. The film begins with Max, a lonely
                    eight-year-old boy[6] with an active imagination whose parents are divorced, wearing a wolf costume
                    and
                    chasing his dog. His older sister, Claire, does nothing when her friends crush Max's snow fort (with
                    him
                    inside) during a snowball fight.</p>
